        <p>
            Mission Bit strives to eliminate the tech divide for youth living in urban poverty and rural areas across the San Francisco Bay Area by building computer programming and professional opportunity pathways for public school students. We provide everything the students need, they just need to show up and be eager to learn. No prior experience required.<br><br>
            We give students the opportunity to learn directly from successful engineers and entrepreneurs who enjoy sharing knowledge. We're focused on project based learning and aim to teach both core computer science concepts as well as the practical skills and technologies that are required to build web sites and applications today.

                        I grew up in an at-risk low income rural community in upstate New York. Entering high school, I charted a path that helped me bust through the challenges of my environment and led to new exciting opportunities and experiences. I feel really lucky and appreciate the help, direction and understanding I received along the way. All kids benefit from a bit of guidance, attention and energy. This is especially true for youth growing up in challenging situations. Mission Bit is my 'thank you'. Hopefully, it provides some support to kids in SF seeking more for themselves and helps create new opportunities if they are willing to put in the work.
