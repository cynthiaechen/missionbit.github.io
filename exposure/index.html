          <p>Mission Bit offers 60 to 90 minute coding workshops for middle and high school age students. We schedule workshops during the school day and after school for community based organizations. Workshops are led by volunteer software engineers and mission bit students that are trained to offer fun and engaging activities that exposure students to what's possible with coding. We connect students to ongoing online opportunities and encourage eligible students to continue their education by enrolling in a Mission Bit course.</p>
